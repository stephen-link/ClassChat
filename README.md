# ClassChat

ClassChat is GroupChat app for iOS developed using Swift and Google's Firebase Realtime Database. The motivation for this app is to allow students to join group chats for their courses. If you just want to look at the code, DashboardController.swift and ChatViewController.swift best illustrate the skills utilized for this project. Also be sure to scroll down and look at the images below!

**NOTE: The constraints are currently optimized for iPhone 8.**

**NOTE #2: There are currently 23 warnings from Firebase's GTMSessionFetcher implicitly retaining 'self'. This seems to be a Firebase bug dealing with the Podfile. More info on this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/issues/271).**
